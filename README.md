Beat the House
#### By Xavier Valtierra

This game is Based off of a slot machine game. 
Slot Machines informally known as a "One Arm Bandit" 
due to the long lever on the side of the machine, and its ability to take all your money.  
Usually, slot machines have, but are not limited to, three spinning drums with different symbols.
These symbols usually correspond to differnt point/money values. T
he more drums you match, the more the payout!

## Technologies Used
- HTML (Hyper Text MarkUp Language): Used to add structure and content to the webpage.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to add styling to the webpage. ex: font-color, background-image, positioning...etc
- JavaScript: Used to add functionality and interactive features.
- GitHub: Used to keep track of changes to the project as well as keeping a secure copy (just in case!). Also used to host project files.
- VScode: A text editor with a built in Terminal used edit all the files in this project. 
## Getting Started
You can [navigate][project] to Beat the House by clicking [here][project].
The game is simple: Match the three drums and you win. Its pretty hard though.
A simple Win condition test method has been built in: Press the "reset" button then press the "stop" button. 
All drum symbols will be set to "A" and text will appear above the buttons saying "You Win".

## Next Steps

Truthfully, this wasnt supposed to be the extent of the game, however, I vastly overestimated my abilities and knowledge. I lost much time.
## Items to improve on or add:
- One Button Operation: Remove all other buttons and have one button for both "spin" and "stop".
- Point System: Add a point system that keeps track of points (or money); Have different point values for the symbols.
- Detect two matching symbols: add functionaity to detect when only two symbols are matching; add points accordingly.
- House fights back: "the house" takes points from you everytime you dont match any symbols.
- Images !== text: Use images to represent symbols instead of text.
